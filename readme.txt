This plugin will redirect the logged-in user if the user have already bought the product from the product page.

== Description ==

I have encountered a problem with my course website.
The user could have enter a product's page and buy a course he\she have already bought.
This plugin have one more card up his sleeve, you'll have a new field in the woocommerce product's page, there you can insert a URL where the user will be redirected to if he already bought this product.
So that admins can see the product page's preview, i've excluded them from the redirection so it will not occur.
